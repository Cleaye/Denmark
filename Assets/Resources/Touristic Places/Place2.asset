  itemInformation: Tivoli Gardens is one of the oldest and well-known amusement parks.
    It opened its doors in 1843 and still has a wooden roller coaster. The Tivoli
    Gardens are a real fairytale, with lush gardens, and a magical amusement park
    set in the heart of the city. No wonder Walt Disney traveled there for inspiration!
